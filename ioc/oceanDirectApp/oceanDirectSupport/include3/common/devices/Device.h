 * This is a base class for all sorts of devices.  A
 * device is really just an aggregation of features
 * with the protocols and buses required to access them.
 * A Device is intended to represent a single discrete
 * piece of equipment that may have several capabilities
 * (features) inside.  The device may communicate to the
 * outside world via seqences of bytes (a protocol) that
 * are transferred across a physical medium (the bus).
